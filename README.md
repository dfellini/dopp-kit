# Simple dopp kit sewing calculator

## What is this?

This is a simple calculator to help you calculate the amount of fabric you need to make a dopp kit.

Install it and run:

```sh
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Note

This is just the stubby beginning of a more fleshed-out project. For now, this only allows for making a dopp kit with square ends. I'll be adding more options soon.
